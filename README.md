# Hodoscope
Analyzing Hodoscope Data

The Hodoscope (originiating from the Greek word "Hodos" meaning way or path) is a high energy particle tracker. It serves as a way of detemining high energy particle hit positions and trajectories by using a SiPM on tile method.\\

Its design can be seen below. Each layer consists of a 3x3 square cells, with each cell housing a plastic scintillating tile. The light from the scintillating tile is read by the SiPM and recorded as an event. Below is a visual display of the analysis that the Hodoscope aims to achieve. It will serve as a particle tracker to be placed before a generation II calorimeter being constructed by [Arratia Lab](https://arratialab.ucr.edu/).
