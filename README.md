Analyzing Hodoscope Data

The Hodoscope (originiating from the Greek word "Hodos" meaning way or path) is a high energy particle tracker. It serves as a way of detemining high energy particle hit positions and trajectories. 
Its design can be seen below. It uses a SiPM on tile method of obtaining particle hits.
